# DA_Nanodegree_project3

In this project, I analyzed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Both hypothesis testing codes and regression models showed the same result that the country lived by the user and different page view do not affect the conversion rate.
